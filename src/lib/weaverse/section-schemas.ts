/**
 * Every section schema this theme registers, in the order Studio lists them.
 *
 * One list, so the two sides that need it cannot drift apart: the server
 * registry pairs each schema with its loader, and
 * `tests/weaverse-registry.test.ts` checks the client registry against it.
 *
 * Schemas only. A loader reaches the storefront data source through
 * `server-only`, so pairing them here would make this module unimportable from
 * tooling that runs outside Next, the test suite included.
