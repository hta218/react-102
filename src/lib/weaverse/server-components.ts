/**
 * The server component registry — schemas and loaders, no rendering.
 *
 * The server client needs two things: the schema, so it can supply defaults
 * and serialize the registry to Builder, and the loader, so each item's data
 * is resolved before the payload reaches the browser. It never renders, so the
 * `default` slot holds a stub. Rendering belongs to `./components.ts`, which is
 * a Client Component module this file must not import — pulling it in would
 * drag every section into the server graph and the loaders into the browser.
 *
 * The schema list lives in `./section-schemas.ts` so this file only has to say
 * which sections resolve data server-side.
