# Editorial image sources

Repository-owned record for every non-product editorial image used by the
Forward static demo. All images are Unsplash photos from the approved source
set, downloaded once, optimized to WebP, and served locally from
`public/images/editorial/`. Nothing is production-hotlinked.

The `Downloaded as` query string records the exact Unsplash CDN render used to
produce the local optimized WebP (single fetch at implementation time,

the approved branded catalog in `public/images/products/`.
